====== Initial requirements ====== <br />
Clients need a Duck Application, where we can see all the Ducks we have with us and all the properties related to the Ducks.


====== New Requirement ======= <br />
Now, Client wants that Duck can fly. So Joe thinks that we just need to add **fly()** method in Duck class, then all Ducks can inherit that property.
